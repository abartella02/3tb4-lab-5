  - Designed an ASIP using Verilog, including a 14-module datapath and control FSM on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA
  - Constructed a motor driver interface circuit using an SN754410 Half-H Driver chip
  - Utilized Intel Quartus Prime for simulation and testing of the ASIP and its modules. Additionally, wrote test programs in assembly to be run on ASIP.
